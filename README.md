## Issue Tracking
Questions and FYIs from the RFC Editor have been added as issues. Please provide your answers in the comments and use a label to indicate issue status:
* rfced - initial label of RFC Editor questions and FYIs (keep this label if the issue is still active).
* question - a follow-up question has been added to the issue discussion. Use @mention to identify the participant who should answer. 
* AD approval required - the resolution of the issue requires the AD to review and approve the change.
* editor-ready - the RFC Editor can update the document and/or close the issue based on the issue discussion.

Feel free to add new issues for new edits and questions. 

The editor will close the issue when it has been addressed either by accepting a pull request or simply closing the issue if no changes are needed.  

## Pull Requests
